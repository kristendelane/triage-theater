She rolls in a wheeled Pixie cart that sounds like it\u2019s dragging a body behind it, and hands you the hospital-issued tablet like it\u2019s a used napkin.\n\nIt\u2019s cracked. The glass is jagged. The corner catches your palm\u2014deep enough to bleed, but not enough for anyone to care.\n\n'Just sign the forms,' she says.\n\nYou look at the screen. It\u2019s frozen on a form labeled: *INPATIENT CONSENT \u2013 Voluntary/Involuntary (System Will Decide)*\n\nYou swipe. It crashes. You tap. It buzzes. Your blood smears across the touchscreen. You try to hand it back.\n\nThe nurse sighs. 'It does that. Just keep trying.'\n\nYou\u2019re bleeding on the intake device and she tells you it\u2019s normal.\n\nYou realize, in that moment, **you\u2019re not a person here. You\u2019re a crash report waiting to happen.**",
