  "text": "The nurse rolls in with a wheeled Pixie cart and a cracked hospital tablet. She looks overworked, undertrained, and two minutes from snapping. Without even making eye contact, she hands you the tablet to 'sign a few things.'\n\nThe screen flickers. The touchscreen registers every touch twice. The casing is sharp. You try to brace it, but the edge slices your hand open.\n\n'It's fine,' she says. 'It does that sometimes.'\n\nYou stare at your hand. Bleeding. Trembling. Not just from the cut\u2014but from what it means.",
