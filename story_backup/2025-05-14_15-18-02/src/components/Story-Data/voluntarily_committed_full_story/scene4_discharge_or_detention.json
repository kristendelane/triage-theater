But something inside you still whispers: you exist.\n\nToday they tell you there\u2019s a 'meeting.' No one asks if you feel better. No one tells you who signed your hold.\n\nYou're seated across from a clipboard. A nurse you've never seen takes notes while pretending not to.\n\nYou\u2019re told your behavior has 'improved.' You\u2019re told there\u2019s a possibility you\u2019ll be released today. You\u2019re told this is your 'last chance' to cooperate.\n\nBut you know better now. You\u2019ve seen the cracks. You know this system wasn\u2019t built to discharge people like you. It was built to forget them.",
