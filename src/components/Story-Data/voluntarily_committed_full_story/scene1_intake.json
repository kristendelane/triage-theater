Your body is in shock, but the nurse's eyes are already scanning a checklist like she's shopping for diagnoses.\n\nYou try to explain that you called for help because you were scared of *how bad things might get*\u2014but that's not what she hears. She hears danger. She hears risk. She hears 'liability.'\n\nBefore you can finish a sentence, you're labeled as a 5150: involuntary hold. No doctor. No full psych eval. Just a scribbled signature and a label stapled to your soul.\n\nYou're stripped of your clothes. Your belongings are sealed in a plastic bag. Your phone is gone. You're handed hospital socks and a paper-thin gown that doesn\u2019t close right. You ask how long you\u2019ll be here. They don\u2019t answer.",
