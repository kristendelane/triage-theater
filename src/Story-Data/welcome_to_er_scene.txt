      "You were a 'good patient,' remember? You played the game. You did the fiber. The yoga. The low FODMAP sad beige diet.

You even kept your voice calm while the 12-year-old resident explained your own body to you like he was giving a TED Talk called 'It‚Äôs Just IBS, Sweetheart.'",
      "You‚Äôre not a doctor, but you are a PhD in physics with decades of lived experience in 'something is very wrong with my stomach and no one believes me.' You‚Äôve worked in high-tech labs, helped launch 3D-printed medical devices, and now? You‚Äôre curled in the fetal position, vibrating like a dying Roomba, covered in flop sweat and regret.",

      "Your boss at the 3D printing job ‚Äî the same one who praised you when you worked through fevers and nausea ‚Äî called you lazy and put you on a PIP for daring to deteriorate. Because chronic illness makes you unproductive, and unproductive is unacceptable.",
      "Your partner tiptoes in, haunted. 'Do you think it‚Äôs time to go to the ER?'",
      "You nod. The Go Bag is already packed."
