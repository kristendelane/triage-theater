# 🧨 Triage Theater

A snarky, choose-your-own-nightmare game about chronic illness, ER hellscapes, and the bureaucratic horror of trying not to die while everyone around you asks, “Have you tried Miralax?”

Built with React + JSON branching logic + emotional damage.

🧪 Features:
- Branching medical chaos written in darkly hilarious prose
- Realistic patient advocacy tools and chronic illness resources
- Unskippable trauma. Optional cats.

Created by Wren Alexander based on true events and unholy amounts of Zofran.
