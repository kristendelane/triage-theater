Still vomiting. No one checked your labs. No one asked about nutrition. You leave in the same hoodie you came in with \'97 stained with bile and blame.\\n\\nYour partner meets you at the exit, barely able to walk. He brought you water and a protein bar. You can\'92t eat either.\\n\\nYou cry in the car, quietly, because the screaming already happened.",\
