📞 Scene: Use It While You Can (Expanded)

You ask to speak with a patient advocate. The doctor hesitates, then nods. "That’s your right."

Ten minutes later, a woman in a blazer arrives, holding a clipboard and a tight smile. Her name tag says *“Experience Coordinator.”* You already know that means HR damage control, not patient care.

She asks how she can help.

You explain — again — everything: the hours of neglect, the psych consult form, the bed alarm, the hallway marination, the complete lack of empathy.

She nods politely and takes notes on her clipboard like she’s scoring your trauma on a Yelp review. You ask what happens now.

She doesn’t answer.

🏥 Scene: Finally Admitted (Expanded)

The attending says the words you’ve been dying to hear: “We’re going to admit you.” You almost cry.

Not from relief — from sheer, soul-shattered exhaustion.

Your partner kisses your forehead. He’s been lying on a disgusting ER floor for nearly 24 hours. His hip joints are visibly inflamed, his eyes raw from pain and fluorescent light. He whispers, “I’ll go rest. Text me everything.”

He doesn’t leave until he sees you behind a locked door.

They wheel you up to the GI floor. You pass zombie-eyed nurses, a janitor who smiles gently, and a tech mumbling “welcome to the madhouse.”

You’re technically “safe.”

But safety here is relative. And it doesn’t last.

🪙 Choices:
- ➤ Try to sleep before the next round of vitals → [Scene: No Rest for the Sick]
- ➤ Post one last TikTok from your new bed → [Scene: Gurney Influencer]

🩺 Scene: Uncomfortable Truths (Expanded)

You ask, “Have you ever seen your hospital go viral for treating someone like garbage?”

The doctor blinks. Her face does a microexpression gymnastics routine: denial, defensiveness, recognition… resignation.

“We’re here to help now,” she finally says.

You nod. It’s a lie. But it’s the nicest one you’ve heard all day.

🪙 Choices:
- ➤ Ask for an immediate consult with GI → [Scene: Paging the Elusive Specialist]
- ➤ Push her to watch the whole TikTok video → [Scene: The Education of Dr. Bland]
- ➤ Say thank you, then post a follow-up TikTok mid-convo → [Scene: Real-Time Reality Check]
