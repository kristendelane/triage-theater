📍 Scene Transition: Finally Get a Room in the ER

You've survived the waiting room, which felt like a mash-up of purgatory, a DMV line, and an accidental social experiment. Somehow, against all odds—or maybe because someone on TikTok noticed—you finally hear the words: “We’ve got a room for you.”

You’re wheeled down a hallway that smells like bleach and betrayal. A brief flicker of hope hits you… until you realize your new “room” is just another curtain-draped cubicle, five feet from a guy screaming about his missing shoe.

But hey. It's not the waiting room.
