📍 Placeholder Scenes to Add:
1. Scene: Finally Get a Room in the ER
→ Follow-up from waiting room suffering, a brief sense of relief, and realization that this is just another kind of hell.

2. Scene: Vomit Ignored
→ You throw up on yourself in the waiting room. No one helps. No emesis bag. Just shame and bile.

3. Scene: Psych Consult Almost Happens
→ You overhear staff say you might be acting to get drugs. You brace yourself for a psych eval.

4. Scene: Abdominal X-ray Pain
→ You’re in too much pain to stand upright for your X-ray. They tell you to try harder.

5. Scene: CT Contrast Horror
→ Tech warns, "You’ll feel like you're peeing." You are peeing. And vomiting. And maybe pooping too.

6. Scene: Dilaudid Doesn’t Touch It
→ Pain is still 10/10. Meds make you vomit and spin. You wish they didn’t bother.

7. Scene: Misdiagnosed with SBO
→ They tell you it’s a bowel obstruction. You know it’s not. They act disappointed when proven wrong.

8. Scene: TikTok as Coping
→ You film sock-puppet reenactments and sarcastic hospital tours while stuck on a hallway gurney.

9. Scene: Finally Seen by a Doctor
→ 12 hours later, someone with an MD looks at your chart and admits you.

10. Scene: Awaiting a Hospital Bed
→ The “winning” ending: after 24 hours, a bed opens up in GI. You might finally get help.

11. Scene: Going Nuclear
→ You yell. Security is called. You’re kicked out. The “losing” ending.

12. Scene: Silenced Advocate
→ You stay too quiet. No one speaks for you. You wait even longer. Another patient gets seen first.

💡 Each of these placeholders should be developed with branches, dark humor, sensory detail, emotional stakes, and linked to existing paths.




🏁 Scene: Partner Must Leave
You've finally been admitted to the main hospital. A real bed. A door that closes. An actual toilet.
Your partner, who’s been lying on the ER floor for nearly 24 hours, is in agony. His central sensitization has flared so badly he can barely walk.
He kisses your forehead, tells you he’s proud of you for advocating for yourself, and limps out of the hospital like a soldier leaving the battlefield.
He’ll crash for days. Maybe weeks. But for now, he’s just glad you’re safe.
(Or are you? See storylines in "The Tube That Ate My Life" and "The Psych Consult That Wouldn't Die" for what comes next...)

🚫 Scene: Kicked Out and Abandoned
You lose your cool. You scream. Maybe you threaten to call the news. Maybe you throw a bedpan.
Security escorts you out. Paper scrubs, no ride, covered in vomit and feces.
You call an Uber. The driver pulls up, takes one look at you, and says:
“If you get in this car, I’ll have to burn it.”
He drives off.
🚗 Scene: Partner Rescue Redux
You call your partner.
He shouldn’t be driving. He’s flaring. But he comes anyway.
He helps you into the car, wipes your face, mutters curses about the hospital under his breath. He knows he’ll be back here in a few days — your condition hasn’t magically improved — but he doesn’t say it.
He just holds your hand the whole ride home.
