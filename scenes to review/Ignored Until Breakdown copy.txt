🟡 Scene: Ignored Until You Break Down

Hours pass. Maybe days. You’re not sure. The clock ticks like a heart monitor, each second a reminder that you’re still here. Still in pain. Still ignored.

A nurse dropped off a barf bag three hours ago. You filled it. Nobody came. Another patient has been seen, discharged, and replaced by a guy eating Funyuns who keeps farting loudly.

Your body is crumpled in the wheelchair, head tilted back, mouth dry. You text your partner.

> "Still here. Nobody has come. Don’t know if I can do this."

You stare at the wall until it blurs. Then you start to cry. Silently, at first. Then hard.

The breakdown is not dramatic. It is quiet, desperate, and so profoundly tired it doesn’t even feel like emotion anymore.

Choices:
- 💬 Text your partner to call patient advocacy
- 🫥 Dissociate and stare at the floor until someone checks your pulse
- 🔊 Start live-streaming your meltdown to force visibility
