      "It didn\u2019t start with an ambulance. It started with pain. Not just any pain \u2014 character development pain. The kind that peels your eyelids open at 3 a.m., folds you in half like a crusty yoga mat, and whispers through clenched teeth, \u2018Get ready. It\u2019s your turn in the Hunger Games: Chronic Edition.\u2019",
      "You were a good patient, remember? You did everything they said. The yoga. The fiber. The low-FODMAP sad beige diet that made your soul wither one bland, gluten-free bite at a time. You took the pills they gave you \u2014 even when they made everything worse. You sat through lectures from doctors who wouldn\u2019t survive a single day in your body. You smiled while strangers on the internet told you to \u2018just manifest better digestion.\u2019",
      "You stayed calm while a 12-year-old resident explained your own anatomy to you, like he was hosting a middle school science fair called \u2018Why Women Are Probably Just Anxious.\u2019",
      "You\u2019re not a doctor. But you have a PhD in physics. You\u2019ve published papers, launched devices, cracked formulas that would make most people cry. And yet somehow, none of that has prepared you for the horror of\u2026 asking for help in an American hospital while visibly sick but not immediately dying.",
      "You haven\u2019t eaten in three days. A spoonful of yogurt triggered a full-body exorcism. Even water ghosts its way through your system like it\u2019s avoiding eye contact.",
      "You're curled on the floor, drenched in flop sweat, cradling your abdomen like it's a live grenade. You\u2019ve reached the I-don\u2019t-care-if-it-kills-me-I-just-want-it-to-stop stage of illness. The part where your pride taps out and your sense of time dissolves. The part where you start bargaining with invisible gods, ancient sea monsters, and your toilet. You\u2019ve lived like this for years. Gaslit, dismissed, misdiagnosed, and told you just needed to drink more tea.",
      "Your boss \u2014 the same one who gave you a glowing review while you vomited between meetings \u2014 put you on a performance improvement plan after you dared to get worse. Because in capitalism, there\u2019s nothing more offensive than a disabled overachiever who can't keep up.",
      "Your partner tiptoes into the bathroom. He looks terrified. He\u2019s seen this before, but it never gets easier.",
      "\"Do you think it\u2019s time to go to the ER?\u201d",
      "You nod. The Go Bag is already packed. And the part of you that used to feel shame about all this? She\u2019s long gone. You\u2019re running on fumes and fury now."
