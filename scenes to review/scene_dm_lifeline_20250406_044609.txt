🧷 Scene: DM Lifeline

You DM a mutual you’ve never met in person but who’s been in your corner since your first chronic illness post.

They respond instantly.

“Omg are you okay? Hospital again??”

You type back: “Yeah. They think I’m faking it. I shit myself in triage.”

They send a voice memo. It’s soft. It’s kind. It’s full of dark humor and genuine empathy.

“They once tried to put me on anxiety meds for internal bleeding. You’re not crazy. You’re not alone.”

You don’t cry. You already did that. But your hands stop shaking for the first time all day.
