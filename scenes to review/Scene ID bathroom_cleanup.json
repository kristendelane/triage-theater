Of course it is. You find a few napkins by the sink and scrub yourself the best you can.\\n\\nYour reflection looks like someone else's ghost. Hollow-eyed. Pale. Wet shirt. Sweat shaking off you in waves.\\n\\nYou want to scream. But you\'92ve been taught that screaming makes you *that* patient.\\n\\nSo you wipe your mouth. You rinse your hands. You go back to your seat.\\n\\nAnd you wait.",\
