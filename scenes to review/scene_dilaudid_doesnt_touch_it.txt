📍 Scene: Dilaudid Doesn’t Touch It

You finally got pain relief — Dilaudid, the good stuff. You expected angels, maybe a brief astral projection. Instead? Nothing.

The pain laughs at you. The nausea intensifies. Your body rebels.

You vomit again. Into your lap. The nurse sighs and says, “Try to rest.”

Rest? While your intestines scream and your gown smells like a seafood market dumpster?

🎥 TikTok: Caption reads “POV: You’re on Dilaudid but still feel like someone’s stabbing you from the inside.” You lip-sync to: “I’m not okay (I promise).” #DilaudidDeniedMe #SpoonieHell
