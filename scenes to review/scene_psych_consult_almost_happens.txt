📍 Scene: Psych Consult Almost Happens

You’ve managed to wipe most of the vomit off your gown and tie your hospital blanket toga-style to hide the worst of the bile stains. You even brushed your hair with a fork from your last clear-liquid tray.

A resident walks in, eyebrows pre-loaded with judgment. “We noticed… some distress earlier. How are you feeling now?”

You know this script. You’ve failed this audition before.

You say, “I’m in pain. I threw up on myself. No one came to help for hours. I need actual care, not another psych eval.”

He nods like a bobblehead and asks, “But do you *feel* safe with yourself?”

You blink. “Sir, the only danger here is the Dunning-Kruger convention happening at the nurse’s station.”

He writes something in your chart.

🎥 TikTok: You film yourself holding up a psych consult request form with the caption: “TFW you puke yourself into a psycheval. #JustSpoonieThings #NotCrazyJustInPain”
