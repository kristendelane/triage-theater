🩸 Scene 2: Vomit Ignored — A New Low in Healthcare Theater

They finally give you a room in the ER. You should feel relief.

Instead, you feel bile rising in your throat.

No one helps you transfer into the hospital bed. No one checks your vitals. No one even gives you an emesis bag. You scan the room—no sink, no bucket, no dignity. Just the ticking of the fluorescent lights and the faint screams from the psych hold next door.

You throw up all over yourself. Again.

You press the call button. Once. Twice. Ten times. No one comes.

When a nurse finally strolls in, she freezes like you’re a crime scene. She says, “Why didn’t you ask for a bucket?”

You stare at her, soaked in vomit. “I did,” you rasp. “Three hours ago.”

She mutters something about short-staffing and disappears, never to return.

You wipe your face with a hospital-issued pillowcase. Your partner is gone now—his central sensitization flared after 24 hours of waiting room floor hell. He’s texting to check in, and you lie: “It’s fine.”

It’s not fine.

It’s blood pressure dropping. It’s shaking hands. It’s salt-crusted lips and a gown that sticks to your skin. It’s the stench of bile and broken systems.
