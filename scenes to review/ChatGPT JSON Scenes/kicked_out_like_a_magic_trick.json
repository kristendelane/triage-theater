      "One moment, you're in a hospital bed, surrounded by machines that beep their disapproval every time you move. The next? You're being wheeled through the ER like an inconvenience someone finally decided to solve.",
      "No warning. No discharge papers. No explanation. Just a silent, passive-aggressive parade led by a nurse with the personality of a parking ticket and the moral compass of a wet Band-Aid.",
      "You're in too much pain to argue. The gurney wheels squeak in rhythm with your heartbeat. Your IV is still half-full, your labs still pending, and your underwear still soaked in a medically unsanctioned cocktail of contrast dye, bile, and trauma.",
      "Someone mumbles, \"You're stable,\" like it's a spell that makes your chart vanish and your body irrelevant. Like *stable* means *not their problem anymore*.",
      "They park you by the sliding doors. No ride. No instructions. Just the airlock of humiliation between the automatic doors and the outside world.",
      "You ask, \"What now?\" No one answers. You half expect David Copperfield to appear and take a bow."
