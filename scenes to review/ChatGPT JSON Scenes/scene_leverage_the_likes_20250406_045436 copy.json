📱 Scene: Leverage the Likes

Your TikTok has gone viral — tens of thousands of likes, thousands of comments. Chronic illness communities, doctors, even a nurse with a blue checkmark reposted it with a caption: “This is why people lose faith in the system.”

A young resident walks by and does a double take. “Wait… is this you?”

You nod, too weak to stand.

Within fifteen minutes, you suddenly have:
- A visit from the charge nurse.
- A room (with a door!).
- A doctor at your bedside asking meaningful questions.

They say, “We’re sorry for the wait.” They say, “Let’s figure this out.” You’ve been in the ER for 13 hours. Apparently, what you needed wasn’t a functioning digestive tract — just enough followers.
