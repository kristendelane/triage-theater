        "A tech tries to start an IV. You tell them you need ultrasound guidance. They don’t believe you. Three failed sticks later, they whisper something to another nurse, and suddenly an ultrasound machine appears like it’s been summoned by dark magic.",
        "You're left under buzzing ceiling lights with a hospital bracelet and a bed alarm you weren’t allowed to refuse. You start to wonder if you’re dying or just inconvenient."
