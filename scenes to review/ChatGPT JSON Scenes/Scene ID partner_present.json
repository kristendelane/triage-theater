He shouldn't be upright, but here he is \'97 parked in a corner of the ER like some quiet, invisible guardian angel with nerve damage.\\n\\nYou watch him type with one working finger, pulling up your symptom tracker, your emergency plan, your intake spreadsheet. He\'92s trying not to tremble.\\n\\nNo one sees him either. They never do.\\n\\nHe used to dance. You\'92ve seen the pictures. Now it hurts him to breathe too deeply. But he still drove himself here in a car rigged with cushions and infrared heat, just so you wouldn\'92t be alone.\\n\\nHe\'92s not just your partner. He\'92s your home.",\
