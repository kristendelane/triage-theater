📉 Scene: Kicked Out = Rapid Decline (Updated & Expanded)

Security doesn’t cuff you, but it feels like they want to. One stands by your wheelchair while the other radios for a "wellness escort." That’s what they call it when they kick out the sick girl for crying too loud.

You’re still covered in bile and contrast dye. The paper scrubs are falling apart. Your socks are wet — you don’t know if it’s vomit, pee, or that cursed saline bag that exploded on you two hours ago.

Your partner is outside, slumped in the car like a broken marionette. Central sensitization has twisted his joints and lit his nerves on fire — he shouldn’t be driving, but he is.

He sees you pushed to the curb like yesterday’s recycling and knows exactly what happened. The tension in his face isn’t aimed at you. It’s fury. Controlled, exhausted fury. Not at you — never at you — but at the hospital, the system, the revolving door of baby doctors who’ve never seen a hard case they couldn’t mislabel as “anxious.”

He opens the car door, gingerly, like his wrists might snap. You collapse into the seat. He hands you ginger ale and an emesis bag without a word. You've done this dance before.

You whisper, “I’m sorry.”

He squeezes your knee and says, “Don’t. You survived it. That’s what matters.”

He drives you home like he’s piloting a hearse — slow, cautious, with his body barely tolerating the position. You know this will flare his pain for days. Maybe weeks. And he still showed up. Because that's love when you're both sick: shared suffering and stubborn loyalty.

You both know you'll be back. In three days. Maybe five. When the tube flips again. When the nausea returns. When the pain breaks through the ceiling.

But for now, you're headed home. Together. In defeat — but not alone.
