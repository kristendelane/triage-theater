🧨 Scene: TikTok as Triage

You keep posting. At this point, it’s a lifeline — your digital vomit bag, your last tether to reality.

You start narrating your symptoms like a TikTok chef narrates lasagna. “Okay, so today I’m on hour 11 of no food, six rounds of vomiting, and two failed IV sticks. Let’s see what today’s mystery diagnosis is — maybe lupus, maybe vibes!”

People eat it up. Your comments explode. One nurse from across the country writes, “I’m so sorry. You deserve better.” That comment alone hits harder than all the Tylenol they’ve offered you.

In an absurd twist, a med student recognizes your video and asks the attending if they can help “that patient from TikTok.”

You hear whispers. You’re not just a chart number anymore — you're content.
