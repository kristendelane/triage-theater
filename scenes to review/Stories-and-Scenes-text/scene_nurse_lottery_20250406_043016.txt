🧨 Scene: The Nurse Lottery — Spin the Wheel of Indifference

Triage takes hours. The nurse-to-patient ratio isn’t even that bad — maybe 1 to 3 — but somehow, no one has called your name. You watch three people walk in after you, get triaged, then wheeled away. You are still here. Still shaking. Still in pain.

You’re offered:
- Tylenol.
- A lidocaine patch (for your stomach).
- A blank stare.

The pain is clearly coming from your upper GI tract. You explain this. You say, “I’ve had this before — it’s not muscular.”

The nurse nods like she’s listening, then hands you a clipboard with a psych eval form.

You stare at it. Then at her. Then back at the form.

Your voice catches in your throat. “This is for...?”

She shrugs. “You seem anxious.”

You want to scream. You want to cry. You want to teleport to literally anywhere else. But instead, you do what all chronic illness patients eventually learn to do:

You choose your next move carefully.

🪙 Choices:
➤ Speak up. Try to explain again, beg for faster care. Risk being labeled a “problem patient.” → [Scene: The Waiting Room Showdown]

➤ Stay silent. You’re too exhausted. You don’t want to give them another reason to dismiss you. → [Scene: Hours of Silence and a Bed Alarm]

➤ Cry in public. Not a choice, really. It just happens. → [Scene: Emotional Breakdown, Brought to You by Google Chat]
