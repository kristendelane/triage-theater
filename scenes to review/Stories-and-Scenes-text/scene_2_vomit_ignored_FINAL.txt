🤢 Scene 2: Vomit Ignored

You made it. Past the intake forms, the waiting room, the fluorescent interrogation chamber of Triage Theater. You finally got your prize: a narrow ER bed with stiff sheets and a curtain that doesn’t quite close.

You’re still in agony — bloated, twitching, spinning with nausea. But they’ve given you a place to lie down. You think, maybe, just maybe… you can survive this.

And then your body betrays you. Violently.

You heave. Once, twice — you reach for a bin — nothing. There is no emesis bag. No nurse. No one. Just you and the half-digested green bile spilling across the pillow, your gown, your face. It smells like battery acid and defeat.

You try to call out, but your voice is gone. You slap the call button. No one comes. The curtain is half open — you can hear the nurses chatting. Someone’s ordering Thai food. Someone else is laughing about an “interesting rash in bed 3.”

You are bed 3.

Eventually, a tech walks by, sees the mess, and recoils like you sneezed directly into their soul. “Oh,” they mutter, and disappear. Minutes pass. Then a nurse appears with gloves and a sigh.

“Oh, honey,” she says, like this is somehow your fault. “You need to warn us next time.”

You want to scream: Warn you? Like you planned this? Like your GI tract didn’t just throw a coup mid-gurney?

But you don’t. Because you know what happens when you talk back.
