📱 Scene: Leverage the Likes

Your TikTok has gone viral — tens of thousands of likes, thousands of comments. Chronic illness communities, doctors, even a nurse with a blue checkmark reposted it with a caption: “This is why people lose faith in the system.”

A young resident walks by and does a double take. “Wait… is this you?”

You nod, too weak to stand.

Within fifteen minutes, you suddenly have:
- A visit from the charge nurse.
- A room (with a door!).
- A doctor at your bedside asking meaningful questions.

They say, “We’re sorry for the wait.” They say, “Let’s figure this out.” You’ve been in the ER for 13 hours. Apparently, what you needed wasn’t a functioning digestive tract — just enough followers.

📞 Scene: Use It While You Can

You ask to speak with a patient advocate. The doctor hesitates, then nods. "That’s your right."

Ten minutes later, a woman in a blazer arrives, holding a clipboard and a tight smile. She asks how she can help. You explain — again — everything: the wait, the misdiagnosis, the psych consult form they tried to slide you, the bed alarm, the total neglect.

She takes notes. She promises to file a report. You ask what happens now.

She doesn’t answer.

🪙 Choices:
➤ Insist on a formal grievance report → [Scene: Filing a Grievance]
➤ Ask her to stay while you speak to the attending → [Scene: Witness Requested]

🏥 Scene: Finally Admitted

The attending says, “We’re going to admit you.” You almost cry. Not from joy — from exhaustion.

Your partner kisses your forehead before he leaves. He’s been lying on the ER floor for nearly 24 hours. His joints are swollen. His eyes are red. But he won’t leave until you’re behind a door, with a wristband and a room number.

They wheel you up to the GI floor. You pass nurses on their phones, aides dragging supply carts, a janitor who winks and says, “Hang in there.”

You’re safe. Or are you?

🪙 Choices:
➤ Try to sleep before the next round of vitals → [Scene: No Rest for the Sick]
➤ Post one last TikTok from your new bed → [Scene: Gurney Influencer]

🩺 Scene: Uncomfortable Truths

You ask the doctor, “Have you ever seen your hospital go viral for treating someone like garbage?”

She pauses. You see her face flicker — recognition? Shame? Something.

“Social media’s… complicated,” she says. “But we’re here to help now.”

You nod. But it’s not enough. Not yet.

🪙 Choices:
➤ Ask for an immediate consult with GI → [Scene: Paging the Elusive Specialist]
➤ Push her to watch the whole TikTok video → [Scene: The Education of Dr. Bland]
➤ Say thank you, then post a follow-up TikTok mid-convo → [Scene: Real-Time Reality Check]
