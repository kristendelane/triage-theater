📞 Scene: Use It While You Can

You ask to speak with a patient advocate. The doctor hesitates, then nods. "That’s your right."

Ten minutes later, a woman in a blazer arrives, holding a clipboard and a tight smile. Her heels click like a metronome of corporate apathy. She introduces herself with a name tag that reads “Patient Experience Liaison,” which sounds suspiciously like “Professional Apologizer.”

She asks how she can help. You explain — again — everything: the wait, the misdiagnosis, the psych consult form they tried to slide you, the bed alarm, the total neglect.

She nods like she’s been trained in the art of nodding. She takes notes on a form that looks like it’s never been read by human eyes. You ask what happens now.

She promises to file a report. You ask if that does anything.

She smiles again — the kind of smile you’ve seen on HR reps seconds before someone gets fired.

🪙 Choices:
➤ Insist on a formal grievance report → [Scene: Filing a Grievance]
You say, “No offense, but I’ve seen this play before. I want a real grievance filed.” She pauses. Her pen hovers. “Of course,” she says. “I’ll escalate this.” She leaves. You never see her again.

🎥 TikTok: You film the now-empty chair with spooky background music and a ghost filter. Caption: “She came. She saw. She vanished. #AdvocateOrApparition”

➤ Ask her to stay while you speak to the attending → [Scene: Witness Requested]
You ask her to stay during the next conversation with the doctor. “Just so someone else hears it,” you say. She hesitates, then agrees. When the doctor walks in and sees her sitting beside you with a clipboard, they stiffen like a cat that’s just heard the can opener.

🎥 TikTok: You record your IV bag and whisper, “I brought backup.” Text on screen: “Witness mode: activated. Let’s see if they lie with an audience. #NotAlone #HospitalJusticeWatch”
