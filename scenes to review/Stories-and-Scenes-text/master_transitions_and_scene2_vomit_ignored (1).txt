This structure is ready for markdown linking later.

[Transition Summary:]

1. Any TikTok-related fame (Spoonie Goes Viral, TikTok as Triage, Leverage the Likes, Going Public) → [Scene: Finally Get a Room in the ER]

2. Patient advocate invoked successfully (One Last Plea, Use It While You Can) → [Scene: Finally Get a Room in the ER]

3. Self-advocacy works (Waiting Room Showdown, Medication Roulette, Escalated Request) → [Scene: Finally Get a Room in the ER]

4. Breakdown moments (Emotional Breakdown Brought to You by Google Chat, DM Lifeline) lead to:
   - Comfort from partner → [Scene: The Advocate Gamble]
   - Or another shot at advocacy → [Scene: One Last Plea]

5. Crying in public or doing nothing (Bed Alarm Silence, Reluctant Compliance, Give Up and Post TikTok) may lead to:
   - Scene: The Spiral → Hospital re-entry
   - Scene: Filing a Grievance → Possible administrative action, eventual readmission

6. Snap & Security involvement (Kicked Out = Rapid Decline) → leads to Scene: The Spiral (sepsis and partner has to return you to ER)

7. Every ending choice now branches into either:
   - Treatment begins (via room admission)
   - Treatment denied (via ER ejection)
   - DIY recovery and eventual decline (via The Spiral)

Next Scene: Vomit Ignored — starts from all successful admissions.

[SCENE: VOMIT IGNORED]
You finally get a room.
You think, “Now they'll help me.”
Wrong.
You throw up on yourself. No one comes. No call button response. No emesis bag. Just shame and bile and a plastic gown glued to your skin.

🪙 Choices:
➤ Try to clean yourself up alone → [Scene: Wet Wipes and Despair]
➤ Call again and wait… and wait… → [Scene: The Button That Doesn’t Work]
➤ Rip out your IV and walk to the nurses station → [Scene: The Hallway March]
