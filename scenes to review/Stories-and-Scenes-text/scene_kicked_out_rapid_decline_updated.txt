🛑 Scene: Kicked Out = Rapid Decline (Updated)

Something in you breaks.

The nurse brushes you off one more time, and instead of swallowing it like you always do, you snap.

“You can’t just leave people like this!” you yell, half-standing, clutching your stomach. “I’ve been here for ten hours, I’ve shit myself twice, I’m throwing up blood, and all you’ve given me is Tylenol!”

The waiting room falls silent.

The security guard — the same one who told you sea moss could cure lupus — steps forward like he’s been training for this moment his entire life.

“Ma’am,” he says in that cop-adjacent voice, “we’re gonna have to ask you to calm down.”

You don’t calm down.

You’re tired. You’re in pain. You’re afraid you’re dying. And now you’re being punished for showing symptoms *loudly*.

Then — like a magic trick — you’re outside.

No discharge summary. No medication. Just your hospital bracelet, a vomit-stained gown, and a plastic bag of belongings tossed at you like greasy takeout.

You sit on the curb, watching other patients be wheeled in — wheeled in instead of kicked out. You try calling a friend. No answer.

You order an Uber. The driver takes one look at you and peels out like you’re a biohazard. “Sorry,” he mutters through the window. “I’d have to burn the car.”

Finally, you call your partner.

He picks up on the first ring. His voice is hoarse from lying on a tile floor for the better part of a day. He’s mid-flare and shaking, but he says: “I’m coming.”

When he arrives, he winces getting out of the car, but opens the door like you’re royalty. He helps you in gently, murmuring, “They don’t deserve you.” You can see the rage in his eyes, but it’s not at you. It’s at the entire system.

“These people have the IQ of kale,” he mutters, helping you adjust the seatbelt. “And none of the fiber.”

You cry the whole way home — from pain, from humiliation, from the sick knowledge that you’ll be back. And next time, it might be worse.
