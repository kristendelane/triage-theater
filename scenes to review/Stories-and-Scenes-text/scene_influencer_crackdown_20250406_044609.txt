🚨 Scene: Influencer Crackdown

You’re in the middle of filming when a nurse swoops in like a hawk on a rat.

“Excuse me,” she says, tone like ice. “You can’t film in here. It’s a HIPAA violation.”

You weren’t filming anyone else. Just your own eyeballs, bloodied from crying, and your puke bucket.

Still, they threaten to call security. You try to explain: “I’m documenting my care.”

They don’t care. They document *you* now — flagged in your chart for “non-compliance” and “hostile behavior.”

Your phone is confiscated. You’re left with an analog TV, a dead call button, and the crushing silence of being misunderstood.
