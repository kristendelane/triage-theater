🩸 Scene 2: Vomit Ignored — Welcome to Bed 3, Where Hope Comes to Die

The door clicks shut behind you. A bed. A curtain. A monitor beeping at a medically disinterested tempo. You finally have a room.

You think that means help is coming.

Spoiler: It’s not.

Ten minutes in, the nausea wins. You vomit all over your gown, your sheets, and your arms. You fumble for the call button. No one comes. You hit it again. Still no one. The bile is thick and hot and everywhere.

A tech walks in mid-hurl. Says, “Wow,” and backs out like you’re a crime scene. Leaves the door open behind him.

You try to mop yourself with a hospital blanket — the thin kind that feels like recycled napkins. Your gown sticks to your body like punishment. The smell is nuclear.

You whisper, “Can I get an emesis bag?”

A nurse passes your door and says, “We’re short-staffed.”

You are alone with your vomit. And the creeping realization that nothing has changed.
