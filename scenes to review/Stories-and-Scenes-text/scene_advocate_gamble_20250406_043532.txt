🎤 Scene: The Advocate Gamble

You look at your partner. He’s curled up on the ER floor like a forgotten yoga mat, his body in revolt from hours of fluorescent lights, concrete flooring, and whatever cursed bacteria is breeding on this linoleum.

“I can’t do this,” you whisper. “Can you… talk to them for me?”

He nods — slowly. Painfully. But he gets up.

He walks to the triage desk like it’s a war front. Calm, direct, authoritative. He explains your condition, your history, how long you’ve waited, how bad it’s gotten.

And for a moment — just a moment — it works.

They glance up from their screens. They make a call. You’re promised a bed soon.

But then shift change hits. Everything resets. The new nurse doesn’t know anything. The old nurse didn’t write a note. The promise disappears.

You both look at each other, exhausted.

But something shifted. They saw you. For five whole minutes, they saw you.
