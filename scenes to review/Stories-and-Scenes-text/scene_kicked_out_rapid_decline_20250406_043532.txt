🛑 Scene: Kicked Out = Rapid Decline

Something in you breaks.

The nurse brushes you off one more time, and instead of swallowing it like you always do, you snap.

“You can’t just leave people like this!” you yell, half-standing, clutching your stomach. “I’ve been here for ten hours, I’ve shit myself twice, I’m throwing up blood, and all you’ve given me is Tylenol!”

The waiting room falls silent.

The security guard — the same one who told you sea moss could cure lupus — steps forward like he’s been waiting for this moment.

“Ma’am,” he says in that cop-adjacent voice, “we’re gonna have to ask you to calm down.”

You don’t calm down.

You’re tired. You’re in pain. You’re afraid you’re dying.

And then — like a magic trick — you’re outside.

No discharge summary. No medication. Just your hospital bracelet, a vomit-stained gown, and a bag of belongings they tossed at you like takeout.

You sit on the curb, watching other patients be wheeled in — wheeled in instead of kicked out. You try calling a friend. No answer.

You order an Uber. The driver takes one look at you and speeds off.

You call your partner. He’s furious. He’s flaring. But he comes anyway.

He helps you into the car, shaking with pain himself. You cry the whole way home.

You know you’ll be back. You know it will be worse.
