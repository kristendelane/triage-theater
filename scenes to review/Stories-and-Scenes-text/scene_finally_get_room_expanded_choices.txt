📍 Scene: Finally Get a Room in the ER
You’re wheeled through the labyrinth of hallway purgatory, past the “No Visitors After 7PM” sign and the overflowing dirty linen bins. The door creaks open to your new kingdom: a room with four walls, two IV poles, one stained curtain, and zero dignity.

You think: “Finally. Safety. Quiet. Maybe care.”

You are wrong.

🪙 Choices:

• ➤ Accept the room and ask to speak with a GI doctor → [Scene: Meet the Ghost Team]
They tell you, “The GI doctor will round in the morning.” You check the time. It’s 11:48 AM. You ask which *morning*. They smile and leave. You are now on the ghost team — where specialists drift in and out like haunted house extras.

🎥 TikTok: You film your room door slightly ajar, whispering, “Ghost hunters, please help. The GI team left ectoplasm and never came back. #HospitalPoltergeist #WhereAreMyRounds”

• ➤ Lie back and try to sleep — you’ve earned it, right? → [Scene: Interrupted Every 7 Minutes]
You finally lie flat. You’re asleep for exactly six minutes when a tech comes in to check your wristband. Then the nurse. Then transport. Then a custodian named Greg. Then someone from billing.

🎥 TikTok: Captioned “Sleep study: ER Edition,” you film a montage of yourself being woken up by various strangers with a jump scare sound effect every time the door creaks open. #HospitalSleepChallenge #RemCycleWho

• ➤ Realize your room is next to the psych hold and the guy next door is screaming at a ceiling tile → [Scene: Medical Mad Libs]
You can’t make out the full words, but it sounds like: “THE GOVERNMENT PUT AN OCTOPUS IN MY SPLEEN!” The staff doesn’t blink. You ask for earplugs. They bring you one — just one.

🎥 TikTok: A duet video. On one side: you holding a single earplug and a whiteboard that says “THIS IS FINE.” On the other: your neighbor screaming about aquatic conspiracy. #ScreamSymphony #ERNeighborsUnite

🪙 Choices from leverage-the-likes scene:

➤ Ask for an immediate consult with GI → [Scene: Paging the Elusive Specialist]
They nod, make a note, and you never hear back. The consult exists only in Schrödinger’s chart.

🎥 TikTok: You hold your chart up to the camera. “Apparently, GI saw me. I just wasn’t there for it. I was busy astral projecting. #GhostConsult #MedBureaucracy"

➤ Push her to watch the whole TikTok video → [Scene: The Education of Dr. Bland]
You pull out your phone. “Actually, just watch the rest.” The doctor watches for a full minute, nods, and quietly says, “Okay. That was… informative.” She leaves. You hear her yelling at the nurse’s station two minutes later.

🎥 TikTok: Caption reads, “The one where Dr. Bland gets educated.” The camera pans from your smug face to the closed door and muffled yelling outside. #TikTokMD #PatientAdvocateChronicles

➤ Say thank you, then post a follow-up TikTok mid-convo → [Scene: Real-Time Reality Check]
You start filming mid-conversation. “Hey everyone, quick update — I’m in a room now. Doctor says she’s listening. Let’s see how long that lasts.”

🎥 TikTok: The camera is half on your IV, half on your face, lip-syncing to “Why you always lyin’?” while the caption says, “This one’s for the real ones who know ‘I hear you’ means nothing without action.” #ERChronicles #SpoonieLife
