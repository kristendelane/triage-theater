🪑 Triage Theater — The Fluorescent Purgatory,"They wheel you into the waiting room — the fluorescent purgatory before the real pain begins.

You’re doubled over in a wheelchair, clutching an emesis bag and your phone, the only thing you managed to grab before being loaded into the ambulance. The triage nurse looks up from her screen like you’ve interrupted something important — like you’re not in visible agony, sweating through your shirt, shaking, breathless.

You try to explain: “I can’t breathe… I’ve been vomiting… I haven’t eaten in days—” She cuts you off: “Pain scale?”

You can’t even answer. You want to scream 'a 10' but your throat burns and your brain is mush. The fentanyl is just enough to make you loopy, not enough to dull the actual pain.

Behind you, your partner quietly lies down on the filthy ER floor. He has central sensitization, so he paces around the waiting room, afraid to sit down or stand for too long because those are the things that cause his tendons to flare. Eventually, he breaks down and uses your purse as a pillow and settles into the filthy linoleum like it's a bed of nails. No one offers him help — only stares from other patients that silently say, “I wonder if that act will get him seen before me and my 10/10 pain scale hangnail.”

You remember your job. Your boss. The stupid three-step absence ritual: update your calendar, log into ADP, message your boss and her boss on Google Chat. You can barely hold your phone, but you jab out the message with your thumbs:

“In ER. May not make it in tomorrow.”

May not.

You're trying to be professional with bile on your lap and your intestines screaming.

You wait. And wait. You watch people walk in with stubbed toes and wrist pain get called before you. You wonder if you’re invisible — or just female.","• ➤ Speak up. Try to explain again, beg for faster care. Risk being labeled a “problem patient.” → [Scene: The Waiting Room Showdown]
