📍 Scene: Psych Consult Almost Happens (Expanded)

You’ve managed to wipe most of the vomit off your gown and tie your hospital blanket toga-style to hide the worst of the bile stains. You even brushed your hair with a fork from your last clear-liquid tray. Survival couture.

A resident walks in, eyebrows pre-loaded with judgment. “We noticed… some distress earlier. How are you feeling now?”

You know this script. Yoxu’ve failed this audition before.

You say, “I’m in pain. I threw up on myself. No one came to help for hours. I need actual care, not another psych eval.”

He nods like a bobblehead and asks, “But do you *feel* safe with yourself?”

You blink. “Sir, the only danger here is the Dunning-Kruger convention happening at the nurse’s station.”

He writes something in your chart and leaves. You don’t know what’s worse — the assumption, or the silence.

🎥 TikTok: You film yourself holding up a psych consult request form with the caption: “TFW you puke yourself into a psycheval. #JustSpoonieThings #NotCrazyJustInPain”

🪙 Choices:
➤ Ask to see the psych notes in your chart → [Scene: The Diagnosis That Wasn’t]
   You’re handed a copy and your eyes scan the phrases: “psychosomatic tendencies,” “difficult historian,” and “possible malingering.” You post a TikTok with a dramatic reading of the worst lines, lit by the flickering overhead light and pure rage.

➤ Demand an actual doctor for your physical symptoms → [Scene: Paging the Elusive Specialist]
   You make your case, again. A nurse rolls her eyes but says she’ll page GI. They’re “usually responsive.” The word *usually* hits like a punchline. Four hours later, you’re wheeled off for a CT with contrast.

➤ Request a witness for the next consult → [Scene: Use It While You Can]
   You ask for a patient advocate to be present next time. Someone who can document how far gone this place really is. The request is “noted.” Whether it gets fulfilled? A mystery.

Next Steps (Storyline Continuation):
Eventually, you’re wheeled to radiology for a CT with contrast. A tech cheerfully warns you, “The dye might make you feel like you're peeing yourself. Don't worry — it's just the medicine.”

As the dye floods your body, you *do* feel it — along with real pee. And vomit. And diarrhea. All at once. A medical trifecta.

You hear a tech mutter, “This has to be an obstruction.” But when the films show “nonspecific bowel changes,” he sighs and says, “Ugh, one of *those* patients.”

You whisper, “Idiots.”

Back in your ER room, you’re told a bed has opened upstairs. The nurse hands you Tylenol like it’s morphine and says, “Things should improve once you’re admitted.”

You wonder if they mean *for you*, or *for them*.
