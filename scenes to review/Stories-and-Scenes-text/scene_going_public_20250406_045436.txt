📣 Scene: Going Public

You stitch your original TikTok with a local news clip from last year — same hospital, same horror story. You tag the hospital, your local rep, every advocacy org you can think of.

It works. Sort of.

A journalist DMs you asking for an interview. Your story’s now part of a larger trend piece: “Are Emergency Rooms Failing the Chronically Ill?”

The hospital PR rep stops by your bed. She’s all smiles. “We’re really sorry to hear about your experience. We’re looking into it.”

You ask if that means better care.

She offers a $10 cafeteria voucher.

🪙 Choices:
➤ Take the voucher and post a follow-up TikTok → [Scene: Viral Encore]
➤ Refuse and say you want systemic change, not hush money → [Scene: Call to Action]
➤ Ask her to cover your Uber home instead → [Scene: The Ride You Still Can’t Get]
