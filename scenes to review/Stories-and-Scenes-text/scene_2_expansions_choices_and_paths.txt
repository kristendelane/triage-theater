🪙 Scene: Psych Consult Almost Happens

You drag yourself upright, sticky with dried vomit and the faint shame-sheen of old hospital gowns. You try to clean yourself up in the sink, but the paper towels crumble in your hands. There's no soap. The faucet leaks like it's trying to cry with you.

A nurse walks by, glances at you like you’re loitering. “Need help?” she asks flatly. You nod.

She walks off.

Later, a social worker appears. Not because anyone called her — she was “already rounding.” She offers you a coloring book. It's labeled “Adult Coping Skills.” The cover features a meditating llama.

You ask for a doctor.

They send psych.

🪙 Scene: Dilaudid Doesn’t Touch It

You beg through gritted teeth for something stronger. They finally cave — 1mg Dilaudid, IV push.

For a moment, everything stops.

Then: spinning. The room tilts sideways like a boat going down. You vomit again, harder this time. It burns like battery acid. The pain is still there — undimmed, just floating on a cloud of despair now.

You hit the call button. No one comes.

An hour later, a nurse finds you mid-panic, shaking and wet. She shrugs. “Sometimes Dilaudid doesn’t work for everyone.”

🪙 Scene: TikTok as Coping

You angle your phone just right — face half-lit, hospital bed visible, emesis bag in the shot like a sad balloon. You hit record.

“Welcome to Bed 3,” you say, voice hoarse, “where the sheets are damp, the meds are wrong, and the staff thinks you’re faking.”

You pan to the ceiling. “I’ve named that brown water stain ‘Doctor Accountability.’ He’s been missing rounds since 2016.”

Caption: *Day 3 of the Pain Olympics. Still losing.*

The comments pour in: “This is hilarious.” “Are you okay?” “This is my literal life.” “Did we go to the same ER???”

You feel seen. But you’re still soaked in bile.

🪙 Choices:
• ➤ Let the attention give you the strength to ask for better care → [Scene: Try Again, But Louder]
• ➤ Scroll the comments for validation until your phone dies → [Scene: Hope, Interrupted]
• ➤ Someone reports the TikTok. Security is “made aware” → [Scene: Code Gray Lightly Toasted]
