📉 Scene: Filing a Grievance

You call the hospital's patient advocacy hotline. It rings twelve times before someone picks up and transfers you to a voicemail box that’s “not currently accepting messages.”

You try again. You get a different line. This time, a bored voice takes your name and promises someone will call you back “in 5-10 business days.” You are actively bleeding.

You file a written complaint online. The page crashes after you click submit.

A week later, you receive a form letter: “We take your feedback seriously.”

There’s no follow-up. No apology. No accountability.

You end up back in the ER three days later.

But this time, you print your grievance and tape it to your gown like a badge of dishonor.
