🟥 Scene: Thrown Out of the ER

The fluorescent lights hum like a threat. A man in scrubs and a security badge approaches, flanked by a nurse with a clipboard and that look. The one that says, "You're not our kind of sick."

"We've spoken to the doctor," the nurse says, not meeting your eyes. "And unfortunately, there's nothing more we can do for you here today."

You want to scream. Or sob. Or maybe just lie down again on the sticky waiting room floor and wait to die. But security is already inching forward like you're holding a grenade instead of a vomit bag.

"We need the space for emergencies," the nurse adds, as if your four-day migraine, projectile vomiting, and inability to eat don’t qualify.

You're not escorted. You're herded. Dumped on the sidewalk under a sign that says NO LOITERING.

Choices:
- 📱 Call your ride, holding back tears
- 💀 Lie down on the sidewalk and hope someone notices
