📱 Scene: Leverage the Likes (Expanded → All Paths Lead to Finally Getting a Room)

Your TikTok has gone viral — tens of thousands of likes, thousands of comments. Chronic illness communities, doctors, even a nurse with a blue checkmark reposted it with a caption: “This is why people lose faith in the system.”

A young resident walks by and does a double take. “Wait… is this you?”

You nod, too weak to stand.

Within fifteen minutes, you suddenly have:
- A visit from the charge nurse.
- A room (with a door!).
- A doctor at your bedside asking meaningful questions.

They say, “We’re sorry for the wait.” They say, “Let’s figure this out.” You’ve been in the ER for 13 hours. Apparently, what you needed wasn’t a functioning digestive tract — just enough followers.

🪙 Choices:

➤ Ask for a patient advocate while the attention’s on you  
🩺 Scene: Use It While You Can  
You request a patient advocate immediately — not because you trust the system, but because you know it’s easier to be believed when a clipboard-wielding adult is in the room with you.  
The advocate arrives and actually listens. She’s stunned by the TikTok and quietly says, “We’ve had complaints like this before.”  
She speaks to the charge nurse. A few minutes later, you're told a room has opened up. Coincidence? Probably not.

➤ Push for admission to the main hospital  
🏥 Scene: Finally Admitted  
You say the words you’ve been rehearsing in your head: “I need to be admitted. This isn’t safe.”  
The doctor frowns, then glances at your TikTok on his screen. “We’ll get you upstairs,” he says.  
It only takes… eight more hours.  
But eventually, a hospital transport tech wheels you through the same doors that stayed closed for 24 hours.

➤ Ask if the doctor’s ever watched their own hospital go viral  
📺 Scene: Uncomfortable Truths  
You raise an eyebrow and say, “Is this the first time your hospital’s been TikTok-famous?”  
The doctor winces. “I… don’t handle PR.”  
“Clearly.”  
Still, your sarcasm works. He gets defensive enough to prove you wrong — by getting things done.  
You’re assigned a room, a proper IV, and someone checks on your pain every hour.  
It shouldn’t take virality and passive-aggressive jabs to get treated like a human… but here we are.
