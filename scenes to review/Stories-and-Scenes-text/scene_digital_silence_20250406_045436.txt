ðŸ“´ Scene: Digital Silence

Right as youâ€™re about to post your best TikTok yet â€” phone dies.

The silence is thunderous. No notifications. No comments. No validation. Just you, in a gown that barely closes, surrounded by people who pretend they donâ€™t see you.

A nurse walks by. You raise your hand. She doesnâ€™t stop.

You want to scream, but it wouldnâ€™t matter. Your voice doesnâ€™t trend. Your pain isnâ€™t viral anymore.

Your partner offers his charger. But his phoneâ€™s almost dead, too â€” he needs it in case youâ€™re admitted and separated.

Youâ€™re alone with your body again. And itâ€™s a terrible place to be.
