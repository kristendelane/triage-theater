🧨 Scene: The Waiting Room Showdown — You Lose Either Way

You wheel yourself up to the triage desk, emesis bag in hand, voice trembling with pain.

“Excuse me… I’ve been here for hours. I can’t feel my legs. I can’t stop throwing up. Can someone please—”

The nurse doesn’t look up. She clicks something on her screen and sighs loudly enough to be heard in three zip codes.

“You’ve already been triaged,” she says, as if that’s an answer. As if it means anything.

You try to explain again, but she cuts you off.

“Ma’am, we’re doing our best.”

You hear the shift in tone — the one that says *difficult patient* in fluorescent hospital dialect.

A security guard at the far wall eyes you like you just pulled a scalpel out of your puke bag.

You retreat. You feel the label burning into your skin: *non-compliant*. *Demanding*. *Drug-seeking*.

You wanted help. Now you're a threat.
