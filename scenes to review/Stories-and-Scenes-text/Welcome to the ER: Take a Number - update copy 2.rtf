\f0\b Scene: Welcome to the ER \'97 Please Take a Number
\f1\b0  (Updated Intro)\
It didn\'92t start with an ambulance. It started with a year of gaslighting.\
You were a good patient. You went to every appointment, even when you had to leave work early, bike two hours with your stomach in knots, or beg friends for rides. You tolerated it all \'97 the rotating cast of medical residents who never read your chart, the endless loop of \'93eat more fiber,\'94 \'93take Miralax,\'94 \'93do yoga,\'94 and the cherry on top: \'93Are you here for drugs?\'94\
You told them, every time: \'93I\'92m not constipated. I\'92m an ultramarathon runner. I eat like a vegan wellness influencer. I take everything you prescribe. And I\'92m still in agony.\'94\
They nodded sympathetically and prescribed a different flavor of useless.\
You worked at a 3D printing company, finally with decent insurance. Stanford Hospital was twenty minutes away. The GI clinic was walking distance from your job. You thought that meant something.\
It didn\'92t.\
Stanford gave you the same shrugs and suspicion that Medi-Cal did \'97 just with nicer furniture.\
After months of vomiting, bloating so severe none of your clothes fit, and appointments that went nowhere, you stopped hoping. You started surviving. You stayed late in the lab to make up for time lost to vomiting in your car or sprinting to the bathroom mid-client meeting. You popped antiemetics like mints \'97 which you\'92d been on since middle school, by the way, because this didn\'92t start last year. This started decades ago. No one ever took it seriously.\
Then came the night everything broke.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \outl0\strokewidth0 You wake up feeling like a team of ninjas has been stabbing you in the belly all night. The pain is relentless \'97 twisting, bloating, pulsing \'97 and you can\'92t tell if it\'92s your intestines or a demon.\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But the pain \'97 the pressure \'97 it felt like you\'92d swallowed a basketball.\
You couldn\'92t stand. Couldn\'92t walk. Couldn\'92t breathe without crying.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \outl0\strokewidth0 The pain in your stomach becomes unbearable. You can\'92t walk. You\'92re doubled over, gasping, sweat pouring down your face. You plead with your partner to call 911.\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The paramedics arrived. Professionals, supposedly. \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \outl0\strokewidth0 Your partner has to spend twenty minutes convincing them that you\'92re not nine months pregnant and in labor. The bloating is so extreme you look like you\'92ve swallowed a basketball. Your skin is stretched tight \'97 so tight you\'92re surprised you don\'92t burst into stretch marks.\
They try and fail to find a vein. Eventually, they give up and jab you with an intramuscular injection of fentanyl. It hits bone. You scream.\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The bruising is immediate spreads like a Rorschach test. You wouldn\'92t be able to lift your arm for weeks.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 And finally \'97 finally \'97 they brought you to the ER. Where you learned that the trauma of being believed isn\'92t actually better than the trauma of being ignored.\
Welcome to the ER. Please take a number. And maybe a vomit bag.\
\
\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\'97\
\uc0\u55358 \u56977  
\f0\b Scene: Triage Theater:
\f1\b0  They wheel you into the waiting room \'97 the fluorescent purgatory before the real pain begins.\
You\'92re doubled over in a wheelchair, clutching an emesis bag and your phone, the only thing you managed to grab before being loaded into the ambulance. The triage nurse looks up from her screen like you\'92ve interrupted something important \'97 like you\'92re not in visible agony, sweating through your shirt, shaking, breathless.\
You try to explain: \'93I can\'92t breathe\'85 I\'92ve been vomiting\'85 I haven\'92t eaten in days\'97\'94 She cuts you off: \'93Pain scale?\'94\
You can\'92t even answer. You want to scream "a 10" but your throat burns and your brain is mush. The fentanyl is just enough to make you loopy, not enough to dull the actual pain.\
Behind you, your partner quietly lies down on the filthy ER floor. He has central sensitization, so he paces around the waiting room, afraid to sit down or stand for too long because those are the things that cause his tendons to flare. Eventually, he breaks down and uses your purse as a pillow and settles into the filthy linoleum like it's a bed of nails. No one offers him help - only stares from other patients that silently say, \'93I wonder if that act will get him seen before me and my 10/10 pain scale hangnail.\'94\
You remember your job. Your boss. The stupid three-step absence ritual: update your calendar, log into ADP, message your boss 
\f2\i \strokec2 and
\f1\i0 \strokec2  her boss on Google Chat. You can barely hold your phone, but you jab out the message with your thumbs:\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \strokec2 \'93In ER. May not make it in tomorrow.\'94\strokec2 \
May not.\
You're trying to be professional with bile on your lap and your intestines screaming.\
You wait. And wait. You watch people walk in with stubbed toes and wrist pain get called before you. You wonder if you\'92re invisible \'97 or just female.\
\uc0\u55358 \u56808  
\f0\b Scene: The Nurse Lottery:
\f1\b0  \outl0\strokewidth0 Triage takes hours. The ratio of nurses to patients can\'92t be more than 1:3 but somehow, hours passed and no one calls your name. You\'92re offered Tylenol, a lidocaine patch (for your stomach), and eye rolls. The pain is upper gastric spasms. The patch is for muscle pain. You tell them. They nod and hand you a psych eval form. \
As the room spins around you, you eventually decide to wheel yourself back to the triage station for an update:\

She looks annoyed. \'93What do you need now?\'94\
You try to explain \'97 gently \'97 that you need to be cleaned up. That you\'92ve been sitting in vomit and waste for two hours. That you can\'92t feel your legs.\
She sighs. \'93We\'92re short-staffed.\'94\
You ask if someone else can help. She mutters, \'93Everyone wants to be treated like royalty these days,\'94 and walks off.\
You press the call button again.\
The next nurse brings a towel and drops it on your lap.\
You stare at it.\
\'93You can figure it out,\'94 she says, and leaves.\

\'93I\'92m sorry,\'94 you say. \'93But I\'92m in severe pain. I need to be seen. I have a chronic condition and I\'92ve lost a lot of weight. I can\'92t keep food or water down. Please.\'94\
The nurse barely looks up. \'93Everyone\'92s here for a reason.\'94\
You go nuclear: \'93I don\'92t think you understand. If I go home, I could die. I\'92m asking for help before I collapse in this hallway.\'94\
She sighs, enters a few notes, and tells you to sit tight.\
An hour passes.\
Then two.\
Security approaches. They ask if you\'92re being disruptive. You\'92re not. But you spoke up.\
Now you\'92re on a list.\

\uc0\u55357 \u57039 \u65039  Scene: Hours of Silence Before the Gurney:  You say nothing. You slump in the chair and clutch your bag. Every cramp in your abdomen feels like a knife being twisted, but you don\'92t move. Don\'92t speak. Don\'92t risk making them hate you more than they already do.\
Time crawls. Three hours. Four. You ask for a blanket. No one brings it. You ask for water. You\'92re told, \'93Not until you\'92re evaluated.\'94\
Eventually, a nurse calls your name. You\'92re wheeled to a gurney in the hallway. Not a room. Just a hallway.\
You try to sit up and nearly pass out. They strap a fall risk band to your wrist and activate the bed alarm.\
Now you can\'92t get up without it screeching like a car alarm. You ring the call button for help to the bathroom. They say, \'93Hold it.\'94\
You try. You fail.\
You vomit and soil yourself at the same time. The stench is overwhelming. You\'92re covered in fluids and shame. A nurse eventually shows up, sighs, and throws a towel over you.\
\'93Someone will come clean you up soon.\'94\
They don\'92t.\

You\'92re still hunched in the wheelchair, stomach convulsing in pain, when the tears start rolling down your cheeks.\
A nurse walks by. Sees you. Doesn\'92t stop. A man holding his toddler stares like you\'92ve grown two heads. Your partner tries to reach out but he\'92s lying flat on the floor, already bracing his spine against the agony of the linoleum.\
You sob into your emesis bag. You try to muffle it. You fail.\
Someone calls your name. You think: 
\f2\i \strokec2 Oh thank God.
\f1\i0 \strokec2 \
But no. They mispronounce it. It\'92s someone else entirely.\
You cry harder.\
The triage nurse finally glances up. \'93If you\'92re in that much pain, why didn\'92t you say something earlier?\'94\

You nod. \'93I understand. I\'92d like it documented that I requested one.\'94\

An hour passes. Then two. Then three.\
Eventually, someone with a badge that says

\'93Gee, I\'92ll be sure to only be sick when it\'92s convenient for you,\'94 you mutter.\
The nurse doesn\'92t laugh. Doesn\'92t even blink. She types something into your chart with a practiced flourish.\
From across the room, another staff member eyes you. They whisper. Glance back. Whisper again.\
You\'92ve just been labeled. Not officially. But it\'92s there now. In tone. In posture. In the way no one looks at you the same again.\
Later, you pull up your patient portal. You\'92ve been marked as \'93confrontational.\'94\

The nurse relaxes, clicks something into your chart, and calls the next person forward.\
You return to your seat. You\'92re praised internally for being \'93compliant.\'94\
You wait four more hours.\
When your name is finally called, it\'92s not into a room. It\'92s to a hallway bed, one without a call button that works, under a flickering light.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 You\'92re laying in the hallway, feeling the weight of the situation. The nurse\'92s dismissive attitude weighs on you. You wonder if you should speak up about your concerns, but you\'92re also tired of being labeled.\

\cf0 Triage takes hours. You crochet a queen-sized blanket while waiting for a hallway gurney. You\'92re offered Tylenol, a lidocaine patch (for your stomach), and eye rolls. The pain is upper gastric spasms. The patch is for muscle pain. You tell them. They nod and hand you a psych eval form.\
Eventually, someone wheels you off for abdominal X-rays. Standing up is nearly impossible, but no one seems to care. You\'92re hunched over in pain, clinging to the imaging table, and still get reprimanded for being dramatic. They\'92re looking for a small bowel obstruction, even though your chart says you\'92re on two daily bowel preps. The radiologist notes say \'93excessive gas and diarrhea.\'94 You whisper, \'93Idiots.\'94\
Later, they wheel you to get another CT scan with contrast \'97 your sixth in as many weeks. You do the mental math on the radiation. If the illness doesn\'92t kill you, the scans might. You pull up the radiology report on your phone and feed it into ChatGPT. It swears: \'93WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY EVEN LOOKING FOR? THIS IS LIKE MEDICAL BINGO WITH A SHOTGUN.\'94\
You\'92re wheeled back to the hallway. Still no room.\
You try to make it to the bathroom, but the bed alarm shrieks. A nurse yanks you back. You shit your pants and vomit into your lap. You ring the call button every two hours, begging for help. Each time, you\'92re told, \'93Your nurse will be there soon.\'94 They never are.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 After hours of waiting, a nurse finally comes with medication, but you know it\'92s just the usual sedatives. You want something to actually help the pain.\

\cf0 At 7 p.m., the shift changes. The nurses who tried to help are replaced by ones who won\'92t even make eye contact. You\'92re too tired to re-explain everything, and too afraid of being labeled difficult if you do.\
A psychiatrist finally arrives and interrupts your story with one of his own: \'93I once couldn\'92t stop burping for two weeks. Turned out it was stress from Chipotle. You know the gut-brain connection, right?\'94\
You stare at him.\
He nods and scribbles into your chart. The nurse comes in next with Benadryl and and Tylenol \'97 the usual cocktail. \'93The doctor ordered it for your comfort,\'94 she says. You ask for something else \'97 maybe something that helps you sleep through the pain, or an anti-anxiety med to help you cope. She labels you drug-seeking. It\'92s written in your chart.\

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 The psychiatrist comes in and starts asking you questions, ignoring your physical symptoms. You know the drill. You\'92re often misdiagnosed with psychiatric issues because the medical staff can\'92t figure out what\'92s physically wrong.\

Then he offers unsolicited health advice. 'You ever try apple cider vinegar and sea moss gel? Cleared up my auntie's lupus.'\
You try to shift positions.\

\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 The Humiliating MRI Experience\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 After hours of waiting, you're finally wheeled into the MRI room. The tech informs you that you\'92ll need to undergo a procedure to help the doctors examine your lower colon and rectum. They need to see how your body is functioning, and the solution is a silicone-based gel \'97 inserted into your rectum.\
It\'92s not a cleanse. It's not for "cleaning out" your system. It's simply a contrast gel that they need in place to give them something to image when you try to poop. The goal is to assess any damage to your lower colon and rectum, but it\'92s done in the most invasive and humiliating way possible.\
The procedure is uncomfortable, to say the least. They insert the gel into you, and almost immediately, the pressure builds. You\'92re told to hold it in until they\'92re ready for the scan. But the pressure becomes unbearable. You feel like you can\'92t hold it anymore, and you have to expel the gel \'97 and everything else. They wheel you into the MRI machine, still full of the gel and the contents of your body, to be trapped there while the scan is performed.\
You\'92re left alone in that sterile room, the gel mixing with the mess you\'92ve just evacuated. The scent in the room is overpowering, a mix of silicone gel and bodily waste. You're trapped in the machine, unable to move, unable to get comfortable. It feels like an eternity.\
After what seems like forever, you call out for help, but no one responds. You\'92re left in your own filth, utterly humiliated. You scream for someone to come back, but it\'92s as though your voice doesn\'92t matter.\
A male tech eventually hears you. He walks in, eyes avoiding yours, and hands you a packet of wet wipes, offering no extra clothing or sympathy. He turns to leave without saying a word. You attempt to clean yourself with the wet wipes, but it\'92s barely enough. You have shit in your hair, and you still need a shower, but the hospital denies you that.\

You order an Uber, desperate to get home, but when the driver sees you \'97 covered in the unmistakable stench of bodily waste and still in the paper scrubs \'97 he refuses to let you in.\
\'93Ma\'92am,\'94 he says, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \'93I can\'92t let you in my car like this. I\'92d have to burn my vehicle if you get in.\'94\
You feel a rush of humiliation and frustration. Not only have you been through an invasive, degrading procedure, but now you can\'92t even get a ride home without being judged and rejected.\

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 In desperation, you text your partner, even though you know it will flare up his condition. He\'92s been living with central sensitization for years, but despite that, he always shows up when you need him.\
Thirty minutes later, he arrives, ginger ale and emesis bags in hand, ready to help you back into the car. You vomit twice on the way home, but he\'92s there, supporting you \'97 not just physically, but emotionally, in a way no one else has.\
You both know the struggle. He understands. The journey home feels like a long, slow ride of nausea, pain, and discomfort, but at least you have him by your side. He\'92s been through his own battles and still, he\'92s there for you when everything else falls apart.\

\f0\b\fs48 \cf0 Welcome to the ER: Take a Number\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 You wake up feeling like a team of ninjas has been stabbing you in the belly all night, a pain you know too well from your last visit to the ER \'97 the cold, sterile room, the fluorescent lights humming overhead, and the constant, aching reminder that no one seems to believe you're actually suffering.\
The pain in your stomach becomes unbearable. You can\'92t walk. You\'92re doubled over, gasping, sweat pouring down your face. You plead with your partner to call 911.\
When the paramedics arrive, your partner has to spend twenty minutes convincing them that you\'92re not nine months pregnant and in labor. The bloating is so extreme you look like you\'92ve swallowed a basketball. Your skin is stretched tight \'97 so tight you\'92re surprised you don\'92t burst into stretch marks.\
They try and fail to find a vein. You tell them it\'92s always like this, that you need ultrasound guidance, but they insist they know what they\'92re doing. Eventually, they give up and jab you with an intramuscular injection of fentanyl. It hits bone. You scream.\
The bruising is immediate and deep. You won\'92t be able to lift your arm high enough to put on a shirt for a month.\

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 You\'92re laying in the hallway, feeling the weight of the situation. The nurse\'92s dismissive attitude weighs on you. You wonder if you should speak up about your concerns, but you\'92re also tired of being labeled.\

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 You speak up, demanding the treatment you deserve. This only escalates the situation further as the nurse starts treating you as difficult. Still, it\'92s a small victory as a doctor arrives sooner than expected. They don\'92t offer any solutions, but at least they listen. You get a diagnosis for some of your symptoms \'97 a glimmer of hope amidst all the neglect.\

Hours later, the triage nurse finally walks by, muttering something about more tests, as they wheel you off for an abdominal X-ray. It doesn\'92t answer any questions, but at least you\'92re not alone anymore.\

You post another TikTok. Then another. They get darker. Funnier. More surreal. One features sock puppets reenacting your last blood draw. Another is just you deadpan lip-syncing to Billie Eilish while holding a sign that says \'93Guess how many days I\'92ve been NPO?\'94\
Your social media following grows, and with it, the sense that you\'92re finally being seen.\

\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 The Humiliating MRI Experience:\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 After hours of waiting, you're finally wheeled into the MRI room. The tech informs you that you\'92ll need to undergo a procedure to help the doctors examine your lower colon and rectum. They need to see how your body is functioning, and the solution is a silicone-based gel \'97 inserted into your rectum.\
It\'92s not a cleanse. It's not for "cleaning out" your system. It's simply a contrast gel that they need in place to give them something to image when you try to poop. The goal is to assess any damage to your lower colon and rectum, but it\'92s done in the most invasive and humiliating way possible.\
The procedure is uncomfortable, to say the least. They insert the gel into you, and almost immediately, the pressure builds. You\'92re told to hold it in until they\'92re ready for the scan. But the pressure becomes unbearable. You feel like you can\'92t hold it anymore, and you have to expel the gel \'97 and everything else. They wheel you into the MRI machine, still full of the gel and the contents of your body, to be trapped there while the scan is performed.\
You\'92re left alone in that sterile room, the gel mixing with the mess you\'92ve just evacuated. The scent in the room is overpowering, a mix of silicone gel and bodily waste. You're trapped in the machine, unable to move, unable to get comfortable. It feels like an eternity.\
After what seems like forever, you call out for help, but no one responds. You\'92re left in your own filth, utterly humiliated. You scream for someone to come back, but it\'92s as though your voice doesn\'92t matter.\
A male tech eventually hears you. He walks in, eyes avoiding yours, and hands you a packet of wet wipes, offering no extra clothing or sympathy. He turns to leave without saying a word. You attempt to clean yourself with the wet wipes, but it\'92s barely enough. You have shit in your hair, and you still need a shower, but the hospital denies you that.\

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 After the MRI, you\'92re discharged, and they give you paper scrubs to wear. Your clothes are nowhere to be found, and you're left with these barely-holding-together, disposable garments.\
You order an Uber, desperate to get home, but when the driver sees you \'97 covered in the unmistakable stench of bodily waste and still in the paper scrubs \'97 he refuses to let you in.\
\'93Ma\'92am,\'94 he says, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \'93I can\'92t let you in my car like this. I\'92d have to burn my vehicle if you get in.\'94\
You feel a rush of humiliation and frustration. Not only have you been through an invasive, degrading procedure, but now you can\'92t even get a ride home without being judged and rejected.\

Thirty minutes later, he arrives, ginger ale and emesis bags in hand, ready to help you back into the car. You vomit twice on the way home, but he\'92s there, supporting you \'97 not just physically, but emotionally, in a way no one else has.\
You both know the struggle. He understands. The journey home feels like a long, slow ride of nausea, pain, and discomfort, but at least you have him by your side. He\'92s been through his own battles and still, he\'92s there for you when everything else falls apart.\
