🕰️ Scene: Hours of Silence and a Bed Alarm (Expanded)

You decide not to speak up.

What’s the point?

They’ll just mark you as “noncompliant” or “anxious.” You’ve seen it in your chart before. You lean back in the wheelchair, cradling your emesis bag like a baby. Your partner gently brushes your hair back — the only kindness you’ll get for the next 12 hours.

Eventually, you’re wheeled into the hallway. No room. Just a gurney beside a trash bin.

You try to make it to the bathroom, but as soon as you shift, the bed alarm goes off. A nurse yells at you from down the hall. You’re scolded like a kindergartener who left the carpet without raising their hand.

You shit yourself.

No one comes to help.

When they do, it’s hours later. A new nurse with a clipboard and a resting b*tch face looks down at you like she’s stumbled onto a crime scene.

“Didn’t anyone clean you up?” she says, like you’ve committed a personal betrayal by still being covered in your own bodily fluids.

“No,” you whisper.

She sighs, walks away, and returns ten minutes later with one single adult diaper, two dry wipes, and a wet washcloth. Then leaves.

You do what you can, trembling with effort.

😭 Scene: Emotional Breakdown, Brought to You by Google Chat (Expanded)

You don’t plan it. It just happens.

The sob bubbles up from your chest and explodes out of your mouth like a death rattle. You curl into yourself on the gurney, face buried in the hospital blanket that smells like feet and bleach.

A tech passing by pauses, gives you a pity look, and says: “We’ve all been there.”

No. No, they haven’t.

Your phone buzzes. It’s a reply from your boss:

“Hope you feel better. Can you let me know when to expect you back?”

You respond with a thumbs up emoji and throw up into the bag. The juxtaposition is cinematic.

Your partner sits on the floor beside you. He gently rubs your calf through the blanket and whispers, “This sucks. You shouldn’t have to go through this.”

You nod through tears. It doesn’t fix anything, but it helps.

📍 Choices:
➤ Recompose yourself and try again to advocate for better care.

➤ Text your partner to document what’s happening.  
→ [Scene: The Evidence Folder Begins]
