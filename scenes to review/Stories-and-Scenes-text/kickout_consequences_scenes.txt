## 🚫 Scene: Kicked Out and Abandoned
*Branch from: Any scene where the patient has been moved to an ER bed but escalates and is forcibly discharged.*

They call it "behavioral discharge," but let’s not pretend it’s anything but an ejection.

You’re still covered in contrast dye and vomit, paper scrubs clinging to every sharp edge of your body. You had a bed — briefly — but the nurses stopped rounding. The doctor ghosted. The pain broke through and so did your patience.

Now, security wheels you to the curb like expired biohazard.

They don’t ask if you have a ride. No discharge instructions. Just a gloved hand on your shoulder and a door that hisses shut behind you.

## 🚗 Scene: Uber Refuses You
*Branch from: Scene: Kicked Out and Abandoned*

You try to keep it together as the Uber pulls up. He takes one look at the paper scrubs, the half-dried bile, the haunted look in your eyes.

“If you get in this car,” he says flatly, “I’ll have to burn it.”

He drives off without another word. You’re still holding the barf bag like it’s a coupon for dignity.

**Outcome:** Abandoned. Again.

## 🚗 Scene: Partner Rescue Redux
*Branch from: Scene: Kicked Out and Abandoned, also used in early waiting room kick-out branches as an alternate to "Kicked Out = Rapid Decline"*

He shouldn’t be driving. You know that.

But when you call, he hears the rasp in your voice and the chaos behind it and says, “I’m on my way.”

He shows up with wrists taped, face locked in pain. He helps you in like you're made of glass. You know this will flare his pain for days. Maybe weeks.

But he doesn’t say a word. Just holds your hand on the slow, defeated ride home.

**Outcome:** You survived. Together. But broken.

• Patient Bill of Rights (AHA)  
• Sample scripts for requesting care respectfully — even when you’re falling apart  
• How to file a hospital grievance  
• @LittleMissDiagnosed on TikTok  
• Ask for a patient advocate or ethics consult early — before escalation

## 🥴 Scene: Street Odyssey (Try to Walk Home)
*Branch from: Scene: Kicked Out and Abandoned*

The Uber ditched you. Your partner’s not answering. And hell, your legs *sort of* work.

So you walk.

Three blocks in, your paper scrubs split up the back. The cold air hits your skin like a punishment. A guy with a shopping cart offers you a blanket and says, “Rough night, huh?” You nod like a fellow war veteran.

Eventually, someone mistakes you for a drunk and calls the cops. You’re taken to the drunk tank for "observation." No one checks your chart. No one sees your feeding tube. They hand you a baloney sandwich and a plastic tray of orange slices. You vomit both.

**Outcome:** Detained. Misunderstood. Unfed. Possibly re-hospitalized… in jail.

**Resources:**  
• Always ask for discharge paperwork — even if you’re being kicked out  
• Consider carrying a medical alert card or letter from a specialist  
• Scripts for hospital de-escalation  
• Find a patient advocate near you

## 🧠 Scene: Curb Nap of Shame (Pass Out)
*Branch from: Scene: Kicked Out and Abandoned*

You sit on the curb and try not to cry. Crying uses calories, and you didn’t get any Ensure today.

The world tilts. Maybe from dehydration. Maybe from despair. Either way, you pass out like a deflated piñata, right there in the hospital drop-off zone.

Eventually, someone wheels you back inside. Not because they care — because they’re afraid of the optics.

“Patient returned by security,” the chart will say. “Altered mental status.” No one will mention that you were forcibly ejected wearing paper underwear and zero blood sugar.

**Outcome:** Full circle. But worse.

**Resources:**  
• Medical alert cards can help if you're non-verbal or confused  
• Scripts for asking for re-evaluation without triggering security  
• Tips for documenting your ER visit — yes, even the humiliating parts
