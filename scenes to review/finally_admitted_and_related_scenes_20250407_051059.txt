🏥 Scene: Finally Admitted

The attending says, “We’re going to admit you.” You almost cry. Not from joy — from exhaustion.

Your partner kisses your forehead before he leaves. He’s been lying on the ER floor for nearly 24 hours. His joints are swollen. His eyes are red. But he won’t leave until you’re behind a door, with a wristband and a room number.

They wheel you up to the GI floor. You pass nurses on their phones, aides dragging supply carts, a janitor who winks and says, “Hang in there.”

You’re safe. Or are you?

📍 Scene: TikTok as Coping

You’ve hit peak despair, so naturally, you open TikTok. You film yourself from your hospital bed, using a shaky hand and a cracked phone lens.

You whisper: “Welcome to Bed 3. We’re all dying, but some of us are doing it with panache.”

You pan to the corner where the biohazard bag is now your emotional support creature.

🎥 TikTok: A duet with yourself from 6 months ago. Left side: vibrant, pre-hospital you sipping bubble tea. Right side: you now, whispering, “If this gets 10K likes, maybe the nurse will bring me a new blanket.” #SpoonieSaga #ERChronicles

📍 Scene: Dilaudid Doesn’t Touch It

You finally got pain relief — Dilaudid, the good stuff. You expected angels, maybe a brief astral projection. Instead? Nothing.

The pain laughs at you. The nausea intensifies. Your body rebels.

You vomit again. Into your lap. The nurse sighs and says, “Try to rest.”

Rest? While your intestines scream and your gown smells like a seafood market dumpster?

🎥 TikTok: Caption reads “POV: You’re on Dilaudid but still feel like someone’s stabbing you from the inside.” You lip-sync to: “I’m not okay (I promise).” #DilaudidDeniedMe #SpoonieHell

🪙 Choices:
➤ Ask for a different med like Toradol or Zofran → [Scene: Medication Roulette]
➤ Cry and beg for something stronger → [Scene: Psych Consult Almost Happens]
➤ Start Googling "pain clinics that don’t treat you like trash" → [Scene: Desperate Measures]
