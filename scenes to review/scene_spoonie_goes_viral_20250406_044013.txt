📲 Scene: Spoonie Goes Viral

You open TikTok. You weren’t planning to. But you’re out of options, and somehow, shouting into the void feels safer than begging again.

You hold your phone low and record yourself under the harsh ER fluorescents.

Deadpan, you whisper into the camera: “Hour 11. Still no doctor. Bed alarm just went off because I tried to scratch my ankle.”

You pan across the hallway — IV poles, moaning patients, a nurse giggling at her phone.

You edit the video with sarcastic captions:
“Welcome to the Hilton ER. Breakfast included (if you count bile).”

You add hashtags: #ChronicIllness #MedicalGaslighting #ERChronicles

You post.

It blows up.

Hundreds of comments flood in: “Same.” “I laughed so hard I aspirated my Ensure.” “They gave me Tylenol for my open wound.”

You’re not alone.

Someone DMs you offering a lawyer. Another shares a PDF on how to request your hospital records. Someone else tags @LittleMissDiagnosed.

You feel seen.
