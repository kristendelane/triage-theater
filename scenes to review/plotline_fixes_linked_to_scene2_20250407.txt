✅ Dangling Plotlines (NOW FIXED & CONNECTED)

Here’s a list of previously dangling or incomplete plotlines that are now fully integrated into the branching story logic. Each one now leads into either being admitted (Scene 2: Vomit Ignored), getting kicked out, or looping back to the ER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 Storyline/Scene → 🎯 Linked Outcome
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📱 TikTok Goes Viral → Leads to ER Room → Scene 2: Vomit Ignored

💊 Medication Roulette → Leads to ER Room → Scene 2: Vomit Ignored

🙅 One Last Plea → Ghost Doctor Delay → Now leads to Scene 2: Vomit Ignored

🫂 Advocate Gamble → Leads to Scene 2: Vomit Ignored or being admitted (choice-dependent)

🚪 Kicked Out = Rapid Decline → Leads to The Spiral (trying to recover at home), which loops back to ER (Scene 1)

🏚️ The Spiral → Leads to Scene 1 (ER re-entry loop due to sepsis/emergency)

Each path now has a clear consequence: progress, setback, or recursion into the ER system loop. The narrative logic is preserved while keeping everything dark, funny, and painfully real.
