📍 Scene: Psych Consult Almost Happens — Fleshed Out Choices

🪙 Choices:

➤ Ask to see the psych notes in your chart → [Scene: The Diagnosis That Wasn’t]

You say, “I want to see what’s in my chart.” The nurse shrugs. Ten minutes later, someone hands you a few pages. You start reading:

- “Possible malingering”
- “Patient claims to eat, but BMI suggests otherwise”
- “Unusual affect”
- “Difficult historian”

You post a TikTok of yourself dramatically reading these phrases under a spotlight made from your phone’s flashlight and a plastic emesis basin.

🎥 TikTok: Caption reads “Found footage from my psychiatric thriller.” You whisper lines from the chart like they’re Shakespearean monologues. “ACT ONE: The Hysteric.” The comments explode. #MedicalGaslighting #ChartWars

Next scene: CT scan. Because clearly, you're unwell *and* dramatic.

➤ Demand an actual doctor for your physical symptoms → [Scene: Paging the Elusive Specialist]

You say, “I want a real doctor. For my real body. Not my vibes.”

A nurse, clearly annoyed, sighs and says she’ll page GI. “They’re usually responsive.” *Usually*. That word sits in your gut like a rotten grape.

Four hours later, they wheel you down for a CT with contrast. “The dye might make you feel like you’re peeing yourself,” the tech says cheerfully. You *are* peeing. And also vomiting. And… oh no.

🎥 TikTok: “CT Scans Be Like 💀” shows a time-lapse of the tech’s face changing from smug to disappointed as he realizes you don’t have a small bowel obstruction. You add dramatic violin music. #RadiologyRoulette #SBOOrBust

Back in your room, they say they found a bed upstairs. Tylenol is offered like holy water. You ascend… sort of.

➤ Request a witness for the next consult → [Scene: Use It While You Can]

You request a patient advocate for the next conversation. “I’d like a witness,” you say, calmly but firmly. The nurse notes it. Somewhere. In some system. You hope.

No one shows up. But a tech does appear to take you to radiology. “CT scan time!” he says, like he’s announcing recess.

You make it halfway through the scan before the nausea hits, hard. You clutch the barf bag, but your body is multitasking. By the end of the scan, you’ve soiled the pad, the bed, and your self-esteem.

🎥 TikTok: “This one’s for the radiology squad!” You lie flat post-scan, voiceover whispering, “I came. I saw. I evacuated.” The top comment: “If you didn’t ruin the scanner, did it even happen?” #ContrastCarnage #OneOfThosePatients

A nurse meets you back in the room: “We’re admitting you. Things will get better upstairs.” You aren’t sure if she means *for you*… or *for them*.
