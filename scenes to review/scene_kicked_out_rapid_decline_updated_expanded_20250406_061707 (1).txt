🛑 Scene: Kicked Out = Rapid Decline (Updated & Expanded)

You snap. You didn’t want to — God knows you’ve been holding it together for nearly 24 hours — but after getting wheeled back and forth like a human ping pong ball, ignored by five shifts of nurses, and handed another Tylenol while your veins are turning into crunchy ramen from dehydration, something breaks.

You raise your voice. Not even screaming, really. Just… cracking. Crumbling. A scream’s quieter cousin. “I’m in pain! I’ve been here for A DAY. Please help me!” You don’t even get through the sentence before Security is summoned like a genie from a cursed lamp.

They don’t shout. They don’t have to. They hover behind you, hands resting on belts, the threat of force wrapped in polyester uniforms and cologne. One of them starts quoting “hospital policy.” You’re too sick to argue and too exhausted to care. The next thing you know, you’re outside. In the cold. In a paper gown.

You call an Uber. You just want to go home, crawl into bed, maybe cry for a week. The driver pulls up, rolls down the window, and makes a face like he just huffed a diaper. “Sorry,” he says, “not with *that* smell. I’d have to torch my car.”

He drives off. Your breath fogs in the cold. You stare after the taillights like they personally betrayed you.

With no other choice, you call your partner. You didn’t want to — he’s been on the floor of the ER waiting room for nearly 24 hours with nothing but your purse for a pillow and a central sensitization flare that’s probably going to sideline him for a week. But when he answers, his voice is still kind. Still worried. “Are you safe?”

You try to lie. He knows.

Thirty minutes later, he pulls up with ginger ale and emesis bags. He helps you into the car like you’re made of glass — gently, lovingly, not flinching at the smell. “We’ll get through this,” he says. “And next time, we come armed with records, an advocate, and enough sarcasm to break their spirits.”

You try to smile, but your face cracks around the edges. He squeezes your hand. You both know you’ll be back here in a few days. But at least, for now, you’re going home.
