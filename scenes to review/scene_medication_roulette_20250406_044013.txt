💊 Scene: Medication Roulette

You gather what’s left of your courage and whisper to the next nurse who walks by, “Can I please get something for the pain?”

She doesn’t roll her eyes. That’s new.

She disappears behind the nurse station and returns with a tiny cup.

Benadryl.

You blink. “This is for…?”

She shrugs. “To help you rest. It’s what the doctor ordered.”

You try again. “I meant… something that helps with the pain. I’m at a 9 out of 10.”

She frowns. “The doctor already documented your pain as ‘moderate.’ Maybe after labs.”

They haven’t taken any labs.

You ask again, this time barely holding in the tears.

She leaves. Ten minutes later, someone else comes with a dose of Ativan.

You’ve just unlocked the Chemical Restraint Combo: Benadryl + Ativan = the “Calm Down Cocktail.”

Your pain is still screaming, but now you’re too drugged to scream with it.

🪙 Choices:
➤ Refuse meds until something useful is offered → [Scene: The Refusal Gamble]
➤ Take the cocktail and dissociate → [Scene: Float Away in Fluorescence]
➤ Ask to speak to the attending → [Scene: Paging Ghost Doctor]
