📍 Placeholder Scenes to Add:
1. Scene: Finally Get a Room in the ER
→ Follow-up from waiting room suffering, a brief sense of relief, and realization that this is just another kind of hell.

2. Scene: Vomit Ignored
→ You throw up on yourself in the waiting room. No one helps. No emesis bag. Just shame and bile.

3. Scene: Psych Consult Almost Happens
→ You overhear staff say you might be acting to get drugs. You brace yourself for a psych eval.

4. Scene: Abdominal X-ray Pain
→ You’re in too much pain to stand upright for your X-ray. They tell you to try harder.

5. Scene: CT Contrast Horror
→ Tech warns, "You’ll feel like you're peeing." You are peeing. And vomiting. And maybe pooping too.

6. Scene: Dilaudid Doesn’t Touch It
→ Pain is still 10/10. Meds make you vomit and spin. You wish they didn’t bother.

7. Scene: Misdiagnosed with SBO
→ They tell you it’s a bowel obstruction. You know it’s not. They act disappointed when proven wrong.

8. Scene: TikTok as Coping
→ You film sock-puppet reenactments and sarcastic hospital tours while stuck on a hallway gurney.

9. Scene: Finally Seen by a Doctor
→ 12 hours later, someone with an MD looks at your chart and admits you.

10. Scene: Awaiting a Hospital Bed
→ The “winning” ending: after 24 hours, a bed opens up in GI. You might finally get help.

11. Scene: Going Nuclear
→ You yell. Security is called. You’re kicked out. The “losing” ending.

12. Scene: Silenced Advocate
→ You stay too quiet. No one speaks for you. You wait even longer. Another patient gets seen first.
