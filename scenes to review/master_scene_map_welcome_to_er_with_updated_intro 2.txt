🧨 Scene: Welcome to the ER — Please Take a Number (Updated Intro)
It didn’t start with an ambulance. It started with a year of gaslighting.
You were a good patient. You went to every appointment, even when you had to leave work early, bike two hours with your stomach in knots, or beg friends for rides. You tolerated it all — the rotating cast of medical residents who never read your chart, the endless loop of “eat more fiber,” “take Miralax,” “do yoga,” and the cherry on top: “Are you here for drugs?”
You told them, every time: “I’m not constipated. I’m an ultramarathon runner. I eat like a vegan wellness influencer. I take everything you prescribe. And I’m still in agony.”
They nodded sympathetically and prescribed a different flavor of useless.
You worked at a 3D printing company, finally with decent insurance. Stanford Hospital was twenty minutes away. The GI clinic was walking distance from your job. You thought that meant something.
It didn’t.
Stanford gave you the same shrugs and suspicion that Medi-Cal did — just with nicer furniture.
After months of vomiting, bloating so severe none of your clothes fit, and appointments that went nowhere, you stopped hoping. You started surviving. You stayed late in the lab to make up for time lost to vomiting in your car or sprinting to the bathroom mid-client meeting. You popped antiemetics like mints — which you’d been on since middle school, by the way, because this didn’t start last year. This started decades ago. No one ever took it seriously.
Then came the night everything broke.
You wake up feeling like a team of ninjas has been stabbing you in the belly all night. The pain is relentless — twisting, bloating, pulsing — and you can’t tell if it’s your intestines or a demon.
But the pain — the pressure — it felt like you’d swallowed a basketball.
You couldn’t stand. Couldn’t walk. Couldn’t breathe without crying.
The pain in your stomach becomes unbearable. You can’t walk. You’re doubled over, gasping, sweat pouring down your face. You plead with your partner to call 911.
The paramedics arrived. Professionals, supposedly. 
Your partner has to spend twenty minutes convincing them that you’re not nine months pregnant and in labor. The bloating is so extreme you look like you’ve swallowed a basketball. Your skin is stretched tight — so tight you’re surprised you don’t burst into stretch marks.
They try and fail to find a vein. Eventually, they give up and jab you with an intramuscular injection of fentanyl. It hits bone. You scream.The bruising is immediate spreads like a Rorschach test. You wouldn’t be able to lift your arm for weeks.
And finally — finally — they brought you to the ER. Where you learned that the trauma of being believed isn’t actually better than the trauma of being ignored.
Welcome to the ER. Please take a number. And maybe a vomit bag.

📍 Placeholder Scenes to Add:
1. Scene: Finally Get a Room in the ER
→ Follow-up from waiting room suffering, a brief sense of relief, and realization that this is just another kind of hell.

2. Scene: Vomit Ignored
→ You throw up on yourself in your room in the ER. No one helps. No emesis bag. Just shame and bile.

3. Scene: Psych Consult Almost Happens
→ You overhear staff say you might be acting to get drugs. You brace yourself for a psych eval.

4. Scene: Abdominal X-ray Pain
→ You’re in too much pain to stand upright for your X-ray. They tell you to try harder.

5. Scene: CT Contrast Horror
→ Tech warns, "You’ll feel like you're peeing." You are peeing. And vomiting. And maybe pooping too.

6. Scene: Dilaudid Doesn’t Touch It
→ Pain is still 10/10. Meds make you vomit and spin. You wish they didn’t bother.

7. Scene: Misdiagnosed with SBO
→ They tell you it’s a bowel obstruction. You know it’s not. They act disappointed when proven wrong.

8. Scene: TikTok as Coping

9. Scene: Finally Seen by a Doctor
→ 12 hours later, someone with an MD looks at your chart and admits you.

10. Scene: Awaiting a Hospital Bed
→ The “winning” ending: after 24 hours, a bed opens up in GI. You might finally get help.

11. Scene: Going Nuclear
→ You yell. Security is called. You’re kicked out. The “losing” ending.

12. Scene: Silenced Advocate
→ You stay too quiet. No one speaks for you. You wait even longer. Another patient gets seen first.

💡 Each of these placeholders should be developed with branches, dark humor, sensory detail, emotional stakes, and linked to existing paths.




🏁 Scene: Partner Must Leave
You've finally been admitted to the main hospital. A real bed. A door that closes. An actual toilet.
Your partner, who’s been lying on the ER floor for nearly 24 hours, is in agony. His central sensitization has flared so badly he can barely walk.
He kisses your forehead, tells you he’s proud of you for advocating for yourself, and limps out of the hospital like a soldier leaving the battlefield.
He’ll crash for days. Maybe weeks. But for now, he’s just glad you’re safe.
(Or are you? See storylines in "The Tube That Ate My Life" and "The Psych Consult That Wouldn't Die" for what comes next...)

🚫 Scene: Kicked Out and Abandoned
You lose your cool. You scream. Maybe you threaten to call the news. Maybe you throw a bedpan.
Security escorts you out. Paper scrubs, no ride, covered in vomit and feces.
You call an Uber. The driver pulls up, takes one look at you, and says:
“If you get in this car, I’ll have to burn it.”
He drives off.
🚗 Scene: Partner Rescue Redux
You call your partner.
He shouldn’t be driving. He’s flaring. But he comes anyway.
He helps you into the car, wipes your face, mutters curses about the hospital under his breath. He knows he’ll be back here in a few days — your condition hasn’t magically improved — but he doesn’t say it.
He just holds your hand the whole ride home.
