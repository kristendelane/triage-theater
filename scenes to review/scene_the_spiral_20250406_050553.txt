📉 Scene: The Spiral

They discharge you with a shrug and a stack of papers no one explains. You step outside in your paper scrubs, still damp from your own bile. Your Uber driver refuses to let you in the car. “I’d have to burn the seats,” he says.

You limp home, alone.

The nausea hits before you reach your apartment. You spend the night curled around a trash can, the bathroom too far, the world spinning. The instructions say “follow up with GI,” but you’ve already left eight messages with no return call.

By morning, your lips are cracked, your eyes sunken, and your weight is down another four pounds. You try to sleep. You try to eat. You fail at both. You call the ER again. They don’t remember you.

But you remember every second.

Welcome back.
