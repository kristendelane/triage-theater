📍 Scene: TikTok as Coping

You’ve hit peak despair, so naturally, you open TikTok. You film yourself from your hospital bed, using a shaky hand and a cracked phone lens.

You whisper: “Welcome to Bed 3. We’re all dying, but some of us are doing it with panache.”

You pan to the corner where the biohazard bag is now your emotional support creature.

🎥 TikTok: A duet with yourself from 6 months ago. Left side: vibrant, pre-hospital you sipping bubble tea. Right side: you now, whispering, “If this gets 10K likes, maybe the nurse will bring me a new blanket.” #SpoonieSaga #ERChronicles
